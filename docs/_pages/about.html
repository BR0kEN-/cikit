<strong>CIKit</strong> has been inspired by <a href="http://cibox.tools" target="_blank">CIBox</a> in 2015 and born (forked) on <a href="https://github.com/BR0kEN-/cikit/commit/c4f4dd8b86e27c068a94b7022b7910b235c9e9ab">November 9</a>. <a href="https://github.com/BR0kEN-/cikit/commit/6245de17ae533294b24bdacab54493c32cb54fb3">13 months later</a> CIKit got its own license since has undergone a lot of architectural changes and have been no longer included technical approaches inherited from CIBox.
