On January 2 I was riding home from Louvre in Abu Dhabi and got an email from Github that was stating the [CIKit has received the DMCA takedown notice](https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/master/2018/2018-01-02-CIKit.md) and repository will be disabled within 24 hours if I won't remove the infringing content...

I was confused and shocked but have no doubts about the person who sent the notice.
