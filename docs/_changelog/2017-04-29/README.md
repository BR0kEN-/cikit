Migration to **Ubuntu 16.04** is almost completed! Only remote provisioning remains untested at the moment.

This transition will allow you to have updated Linux core, newer Java version to run and install newer versions of Solr, Selenium and Jenkins easily. Also it ships with MySQL 5.7 onboard. Besides, provisioning occurs a bit faster.
